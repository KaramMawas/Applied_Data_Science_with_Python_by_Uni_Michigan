# Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

A part of the course Applied Data Science with Python in Coursera by University of Michigan


## Week2

Work with real world CSV weather data. 
Manipulating the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate that one know how to create
a line graph using matplotlib.
Additionally, demonstrate the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking data for a given year.

## Week3

Exploring charting fundamentals. 
For this week’s assignment one will work to implement a new visualization technique based on academic research. 
This assignment is flexible and one can address it using a variety of difficulties - 
from an easy static image to an interactive chart where users can set ranges of values to be used.

## Week4

In this module, then everything starts to come together. 
The final assignment is entitled “Becoming a Data Scientist.” 
This assignment requires that one identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent 
across a meaningful dimension. One will state a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create 
a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question. One will then be asked to justify 
how your visual addresses your research question.
